In this project, I worked on understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.

In this project, a company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. the goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The project was conducted using a Jupyter workspace environment. The libraries used in this project is: 

  <ol>
    <li>Numpy</li>
    <li>pandas</li>
    <li>random</li>
    <li>matplotlib</li>
    <li>statsmodels.api</li>
  </ol>
  

The datasets used:
